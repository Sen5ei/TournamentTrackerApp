# Tournament Tracker

Tournament Tracker is a WinForms application that allows users to create and play through elimination-style tournaments.

It allows users to create team members, teams, prizes, and then proceeds to randomize the rounds and matchups to create a tournament. If there is an odd number of teams, a randomly chosen team will be automatically transferred to the next round. After the final match had completed, a winner was declared and the prizes were distributed.
